This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes described below.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your Happy Chicken Technology profile fields or Life Events about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your health.

        <span class="my-2">Networks and connections. We collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups you are part of.

        <span class="my-2">As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Information we obtain from these devices includes:</span>
        <span class="my-2">Device attributes: information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Device operations: information about operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).</span>
        <span class="my-2">Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Happy Chicken Technology Company Products associated with the same device or account).</span>

        <span class="my-2">Network and connections: information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Information from partners.</span>

These partners provide information about your activities off Happy Chicken Technology—including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you have a CrispyHunt account or are logged into CrispyHunt. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="row my-3">
        <h4>II. How do we use this information?</h4>
        <span class="my-2">We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the Happy Chicken Technology Products and related services described in the CrispyHunt Terms. Here's how:</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including your News Feed, CrispyHunt Feed, CrispyHunt Stories and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and off our Products. Information across Happy Chicken Technology Products and devices: We connect information about your activities on different Happy Chicken Technology Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Happy Chicken Technology Products you use, wherever you use them. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Happy Chicken Technology Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Location-related information: We use location-related information-such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of Happy Chicken Technology Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).</span>
        <span class="my-2">Product research and development: We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Face recognition: If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special protections under the laws of your country.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Ads and other sponsored content: We use the information we have about you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and services.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Promote safety, integrity and security.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Happy Chicken Technology Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when someone needs help.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Communicate with you.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Research and innovate for social good.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.

    </div>

    <div class="row my-3">
        <h4>III. How is this information shared?</h4>
        <span class="my-2">Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Sharing on Happy Chicken Technology Products</span>
        <span class="my-2">People and accounts you share and communicate with</span>
        <span class="my-2">When you use CrispyHunt to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their CrispyHunt Stories.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your CrispyHunt username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile and content you share on CrispyHunt, public CrispyHunt account or any other public forum, such as Happy Chicken Technology Marketplace. You, other people using Happy Chicken Technology Products including CrispyHunt, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Happy Chicken Technology Company Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Content others share or reshare about you</span>
        <span class="my-2">You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.</span>
        <span class="my-2">People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</span>
        <span class="my-2">People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on CrispyHunt, or when you last used our Products.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</span>
        <span class="my-2">When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on CrispyHunt, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of CrispyHunt friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Happy Chicken Technology friends from you, or information about any of your CrispyHunt followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Happy Chicken Technology and CrispyHunt (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Requesting any other data will require our approval.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">New owner.</span>
        <span class="my-2">If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Sharing with Third-Party Partners</span>
        <span class="my-2">We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Happy Chicken Technology Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Partners who use our analytics services.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Happy Chicken Technology Products. For example, Page admins and CrispyHunt business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Advertisers.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Happy Chicken Technology ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Measurement partners.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</span>
        <span class="my-2">When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Researchers and academics.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</span>
        <span class="my-2 font-weight-bold">Law enforcement or legal requests.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="row my-3">
        <h4>IV. How do the Happy Chicken Technology Companies work together?</h4>
        <span class="my-2">Happy Chicken Technology Products including CrispyHunt share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Happy Chicken Technology Companies to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Happy Chicken Technology Company Products you use. We also process information about you across the Happy Chicken Technology Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Happy Chicken Technology Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Happy Chicken Technology Company Products.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="row my-3">
        <h4>V. How can I manage or delete information about me?</h4>
        <span class="my-2">We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data.</span>
        <span class="my-2">We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Happy Chicken Technology Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Happy Chicken Technology, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time.</span>
        <span class="my-2">When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account, please contact us.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="row my-3">
        <h4>VI. How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</h4>
        <span class="my-2">We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others: In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of Hong Kong when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</span>
        <span class="my-2">When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</span>
        <span class="my-2">Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Happy Chicken Technology) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="row my-3">
        <h4>VII. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</h4>
        <span class="my-2">We share information globally, both internally within the Happy Chicken Technology Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in Hong Kong or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the CrispyHunt Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to Hong Kong and other countries.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="row my-3">
        <h4>VIII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</h4>

    </div>
